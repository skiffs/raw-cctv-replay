The RAW CCTV Replay system provides a system for playing back video data stored on hard drives taken from video surveillance (CCTV) equipment.

Since there are many different CCTV systems, and also many differing schemes for storing their data on disk, the RAW CCTV Replay system uses a plugin mechanism to handle the decoding of specific data. This is specifically designed to make it relatively simple to write new plugins as necessary.
